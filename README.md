# SublimeText syntax for Silvaco TCAD

This is the sublime text syntax file for Silvaco's TCAD. Right now only has keywords for Deckbuild, Atlas and Athena.

TODO:

[ ] Publish on package control
[ ] case insensitive keywords
[ ] Actually do something with the keywords, other than just highlight.
[ ] Profit?
